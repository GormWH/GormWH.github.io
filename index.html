        <p>
        This webpage was made to record my own learnings and projects.
        Actually, this webpage itself is a project too!
        I'm planning to upload mainly about fluid dynamics and programming.
        </p>

        <!-- fluid -->
        <h2>Fluid Dynamics & CFD</h2>
        <p>
        The reason I'm posting about fluid dynamics and CFD(computational fluid dynamics) is because I'm majoring in them! During my studies I went through many difficulties. so I decided to record my learnings as to strengthen my memory and also provide tutorials for beginners. I hope my page is helpful.
        </p>

        <!-- programming -->
        <h2>Programming</h2>
        <p>
        Although I'm not a developer, I use programming a lot. For practicing purpose, I'll record my programming knowledge and project plans.
