# AGENTS.md

Single source of truth **index** for contributors and AI agents. Claude Code reaches this file via `CLAUDE.md`, which is a symlink to this file.

Detailed information lives in [`docs/`](docs/README.md). This file stays short on purpose: scan the table, jump to the file you need.

Root `README.md` is visitor-facing; `AGENTS.md` is the contributor index. Subjects covered in both must agree, but tone may differ.

## Project at a glance

Astro 6 static site for a personal portfolio, deployed to GitHub Pages at `https://GormWH.github.io` (user/org root, no project subpath).

- Package manager: **pnpm** (Node `>=22.12.0`).
- Deploy gate: `pnpm build`. Run `pnpm check` before pushing.
- No test suite, no linter, no formatter.

## Rules for this index

See [docs/governance.md](docs/governance.md#rules) for the rules governing this file.

## Hard rules that always apply (do not move into `docs/`)

These are short enough to live here and important enough to be unmissable:

- **No emoji** in copy. Allowed glyphs: `→ · — ※ ✻`. ([`docs/brand-voice.md`](docs/brand-voice.md))
- **No `tailwind.config.*`.** Tokens live in `@theme { ... }` inside `src/styles/global.css`. ([`docs/styling.md`](docs/styling.md))
- **No `--container-content`** — collides with the `max-content` CSS keyword. ([`docs/styling.md`](docs/styling.md))
- **No AI / tooling attribution in commits.** No `Co-Authored-By: Claude …`, no `.omc/plans/…` references. ([`docs/commit-style.md`](docs/commit-style.md))
- **Sections go in `src/features/<route>/`**, not `src/components/`. ([`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md))
